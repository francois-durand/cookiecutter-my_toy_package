===========================
Cookiecutter My Toy Package
===========================

Cookiecutter_ template for a Python package.

This is a fork of https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage/. Main differences:

* Personalize default options.
* Include example files for classes, with examples of documentation and testing.
* Documentation:

  * Use ``sphinx.ext.napoleon`` to benefit from NumPy style of documentation.
  * Use ReadTheDocs theme.
  * Add a "reference" section in the documentation of the package.

* Minor tweaks in ``setup.py``.
* Remove version numbers from ``requirements_dev.txt``.
* Make Travis run also the doctests.
* Use Codecov.
